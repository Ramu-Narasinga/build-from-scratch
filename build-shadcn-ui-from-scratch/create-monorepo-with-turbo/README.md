# Build shadcn-ui/ui from scratch
The goal of this project is to learn the patterns and best practices used in building shadcn-ui/ui. 
Instead of rewriting the complete code, we will focus on the parts that are repeated to make this project complete. 
For example, if you learn how to write a Button component and build a documentation page and display this compoonent,
this approach can be replicated with other components. 
Learn the fundamenetals that can be repeated for other components.


## Roadmap
These are the chapters that come with lessons, realistically, it wouldn't make sense to build all those components provided on shadcn-ui/ui,
but when you know the logic behind building these components, displaying them on a docs/components page gives you a good start in understanding
shadcn-ui/ui codebase. Feel free to use these lessons to learn from them, in case you are aiming to create a pull request or fix existing issues
on this repo.

1. Husky configuration
2. Build Button component
3. Build Card component
4. Build Accordion component
5. Build docs page that shows these components with the ability to copy the code snippet
6. Build components page that shows these components built
7. Build themes page that demonstrates 2 or 3 themes
8. Build "Blocks" page with one example.
